<!-- 
    Behing the scene browser takes class as className  
    set attributes always overwrite the given value on the webpage
    we can style this page by using style in console
    we can get the content by using textContent,innerHTML,innerText

    // difference between textContent and innerText
    when we use innerText it shows the data that is shown on the screen while when we use textContent it show the content that is present in the id

    for innerHtml it return the complete value even if there is a html written inside the id

    querySelector return the first query that is present on the code while querySelectorAll return all the queries 

    for class we use '.' for id we use '#'

    nodeList is not a complete array. It looks like array and has some property that works like array
